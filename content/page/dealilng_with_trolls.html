  <p>The Internet has become one of the core communications media of
  our time. Its growth has brought many positives: we are able to share
  and discuss ideas with people from vastly diverse cultures and walks
  of life; it's made our one-to-one communication almost instant, and
  made one-to-many and many-to-many communication much simpler.
  <p>Unfortunately, these same properties have given rise to Internet
  denizens who want to see meaningful discussions deteriorate into a
  morass of ad hominem attacks and meaningless "commentary" – be it for
  entertainment or to attack and derail discussion of issues they
  disagree with. Presenting: The Internet Troll.
  <h4>What is a Troll?</h4>
  <p>A Troll's usual modus operandi is to post content that will create
  emotional reactions in other people. The type of content, and the
  reaction they seek, varies according to the type of Troll - but
  whatever response they may be looking for, eliciting responses is
  almost always the aim of the game. Trolls may be specifically seeking
  to derail a discussion, or purely "for the lolz". They may present as
  someone in antagonistic disagreement with the issue at hand, but are
  not actually interested in productive debate and are seeking only to
  sow discord.
  <p>While the antagonistic Troll may be easier to spot, a far more
  insidious variety is the Concern Troll. Concern Trolls claim to share
  your stance, but express their "concerns" they demand be addressed,
  or attack the tone of an argument.
  <p>Trolls can move in packs, or even create multiple "sockpuppet"
  accounts for support. Discussions can be targeted and come under
  concerted attack with more than one Troll trolling. A Concern Troll
  and an "antag" can work well together by "debating" both sides of the
  argument.
  <p>From personal experience I've seen women disproportionately
  targeted by Trolls of all stripes, and feminism and social justice
  content seems to suffer particularly toxic trolling. It's no wonder
  that dealing with Trolls, and the burnout that so often comes with
  the task, is of such concern to Feminists online.
  <h4>The Effects of Trolling</h4>
  <p>Trolling derails discussion, disrupting what is often the purpose
  of comment threads. Their posts contribute to a negative and often
  hostile atmosphere, dissuading people who might otherwise
  participate. Extensive trolling can even create an environment where
  new users are distrusted and drive the discussion further into the
  ground.
  <p>Additionally, Trolling can be actively harmful to the people
  exposed to it. Trolls habitually use triggering subject matter in
  order to get an emotional reaction, which they can then dismiss.
  Particularly toxic Trolls are not shy of telling people to "go kill
  themselves,” and other statements that can create real risk for those
  suffering from suicidal ideation.
  <p>The burnout that can be experienced from dealing with Trolls can
  be deeply impacting on psychological health. It's important, when
  faced with the ubiquity of Internet Trolls, to be armed with tools to
  deal with them in a way that is safe and effective for yourself and
  others.
  <h4>Dealing With Trolls</h4>
  <p>First, remember: you are under no obligation to deal with Trolls
  in any particular way, despite their shrill cries of "Free speech!",
  "Hysterics!", or "If you won't teach me, how will I learn?!".
  <p>Secondly, no matter what you do or don't do: Trolls can escalate
  their behavior in response, seeking to further provoke.
  <h5>Method One: Ignore Them<br>
  Or, "don't feed the trolls."</h5>
  <p>As the Troll is attempting to get a response, don't give them one.
  Don't respond to their posts, once you have identified them as a
  Troll. Don't respond in any way. Ignore them completely. This tends
  to result in them either leaving or cursing ineffectually at a silent
  forum. At this point, consider Method Four.
  <p>Such silence can be difficult to achieve without the co-operation
  of everyone in the discussion.
  <h5>Method Two: Engage The Troll</h5>
  <p>There's at least one good reason to engage with Trolls, even if
  briefly. However, strong consideration should go into the decision.
  You should be aware of the toll it may take for you to keep your cool
  while dealing with the Troll and the possible effects on mental
  health and stability. Replying to a Troll can ensure that the toxic
  opinions put forward do not go unopposed. Even a single reasoned
  response can serve this purpose. Engaging further can also lead to
  good results, if you feel you have the stamina to do so.
  <p>The technique to apply here is of un-emotive and reasoned
  response. Continue to deny them their food; reasoned and dogged
  argument is their poison. A Troll, when faced with this tactic, is
  likely to escalate in order to seek a response from you. The
  continued lack of it tends to drive them to the same reaction as
  denying them response by silence, while providing your thread with
  ample counter-arguments for future readers.
  <h5>Method Three: Trolling Back</h5>
  <p>It can be fun to Troll a Troll; however this is not recommended as
  a sustainable way of dealing with them. It has a very real risk of
  descending into a flame war, especially if it attracts other Trolls,
  or otherwise blameless users, looking for "fun."
  <h5>Method Four: The Banhammer</h5>
  <p>While not available to most users, as a moderator choosing to
  delete a Troll's posts is an entirely legitimate decision and one you
  should never feel you do not have the right to make. As is choosing
  to ban a Troll should your judgement call for it. There is no need to
  feel bad about dealing harshly with Trolls, no matter how many cries
  of "freeze peaches" may go up. Always remember that your blog, your
  forum, your Facebook page is your space on the Internet - do what you
  need to in order to be safe.
  <p>Removing Trolls and Trolling posts can help deny them sustenance,
  as it minimizes the amount of response the troll can receive.
  <p>A strongly enforced moderation policy can have flow-on benefits,
  beyond the individual Troll: it helps to keep discussions on track,
  it minimises the exposure of actively harmful content, and can even
  deter future Trolling by sending a clear message.
  <p>The main thing to remember, when dealing with Trolls, is to stay
  safe. If that means disengaging, seeking moderator intervention, or
  swinging the banhammer mercilessly: the Internet is your space, too.
