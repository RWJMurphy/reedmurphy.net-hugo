<p>But first, a quote to set the mood.</p>



<!--more-->

<blockquote><em>Through me you pass into the city of woe:<br/>
Through me you pass into eternal pain:<br/>
Through me among the people lost for aye.<br/>
Justice the founder of my fabric mov'd:<br/>
To rear me was the task of power divine,<br/>
Supremest wisdom, and primeval love.<br/>
Before me things create were none, save things<br/>
Eternal, and eternal I endure.<br/>
<br/>
All hope abandon ye who enter here.<br/>
</em></blockquote>
