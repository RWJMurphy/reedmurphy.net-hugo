<p>Announcing the release of my second plugin for GetSimple (and my entry in <a href="http://get-simple.info/create-a-thon/">GetSimple's March 2012 Create-a-thon</a>): <a href="http://www.reedmurphy.net/projects/getsimple-simple-backups">Simple Backups</a>.</p>

<p>Continuing my trend of uncreatively named extensions, Simple Backups aims to make backing up your GetSimple website simple. It supports multiple schedules, automatic backup rotation on a per-schedule basis, and storing backups locally, on FTP, in S3 or sending them via email (more details on <a href="http://www.reedmurphy.net/projects/getsimple-simple-backups">the project page</a>).
