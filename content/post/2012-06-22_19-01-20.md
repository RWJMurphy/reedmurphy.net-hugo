[Oracle agrees to $0 damages in Google v. Oracle trial](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/06/oracle-accepts-0-in-damages-from-google-moves-toward-appeal/)

> Oracle could have sought damages for the small amount of code copying Google was found guilty of, but it chose not to. A stipulation and proposed order that Oracle and Google submitted to Judge William Alsup in US District Court in San Francisco today called for $0 of damages "related to Google’s infringement of Oracle’s copyrights in connection with (1) the rangeCheck code in TimSort.java and ComparableTimSort.java, and (2) the eight decompiled files (seven 'Impl.java' files and one 'ACL' file)."

> Upon seeing the proposal, Judge Alsup asked, "Is there a catch I need to be aware of?" ...

Judge Alsup continues to go up in my books.
