[The Verge reports this morning](http://www.theverge.com/2012/6/6/3067523/linkedin-password-leak-online) that a user of a Russian forum has leaked nearly 6.5 million unsalted, SHA-1 hashed LinkedIn account passwords.

While [the original forum post](http://forum.insidepro.com/viewtopic.php?p=96122) appears to be down, [a Google cache of the thread is still available](http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?hl=en&safe=off&q=cache%3Aforum.insidepro.com%2Fviewtopic.php%3Fp%3D96122).

Reddit user [312c](http://www.reddit.com/user/312c) has [re-uploaded the original list of hashes to mediafire](http://www.mediafire.com/?bmuo1y3puku4rs5) for anyone interested.

The scariest part is that LinkedIn, with 160 million+ users, were still storing hashes unsalted and hashed using only a general purpose hashing algorithm. Perhaps someone should show their developers [How To Safely Store A Password](http://codahale.com/how-to-safely-store-a-password/) (Spoiler: use [bcrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt)).

**Update**: [LinkedIn have confirmed the leak:](http://blog.linkedin.com/2012/06/06/linkedin-member-passwords-compromised/)

> Members that have accounts associated with the compromised passwords will notice that their LinkedIn account password is no longer valid.

> ...

> It is worth noting that the affected members who update their passwords and members whose passwords have not been compromised benefit from the enhanced security we just recently put in place, which includes hashing and salting of our current password databases.

While the addition of salts to their hashes is good news, I'd like to see a more detailed write up on how the hashes were leaked, and their plans for minimising the damage should this happen again.
