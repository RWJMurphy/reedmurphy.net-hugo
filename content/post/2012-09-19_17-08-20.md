Just a quick followup to yesterday's post, Microsoft have [issued security advisory 2757760](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/security/advisory/2757760), "Vulnerability in Internet Explorer Could Allow Remote Code Execution".

While a patch is yet to be released, the advisory contains instructions to prevent the vulnerability being exploited by installing and configuring the Enhanced Mitigation Experience Toolkit, or EMET.
