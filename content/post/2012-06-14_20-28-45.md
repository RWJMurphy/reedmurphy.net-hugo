ICANN, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, today [released the list of applications for new Top Level Domains](http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/application-results/strings-1200utc-13jun12-en).

While there are over 1900 individual applications, there are only 1409 distinct TLDs under application. TLDs like .app, .inc, .home and .art are all highly contended, with more than 10 applications vying for the rights to each.

Coming out on top by sheer number of applied for TLDs is Google, with 101 applications from the obvious (.android, .chrome, .google) to the interesting (.baby, .free, .lol, .prof). Amazon are a close second with 76 applications, with Top Level Domain Holdings coming in third with 70.
