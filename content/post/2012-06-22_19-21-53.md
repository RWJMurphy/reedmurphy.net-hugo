While it's no Sydney AWS datacentre, Amazon recently [announced the release of a Sydney edge location for their Route 53 and Cloudfront services](http://aws.typepad.com/aws/2012/06/cloudfront-route-53-edge-location-in-sydney-australia.html).

With the vast majority of Australia's international Internet connectivity terminating in Sydney, this should provide the opporunity for drastic latency improvements to Australian consumers of Amazon's DNS and CDN services.
