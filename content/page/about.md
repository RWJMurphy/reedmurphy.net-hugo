## ... this site
This site houses a collection of rambling notes, links to and commentary on things I find interesting, hopefully interspersed with some useful information.

## ... me
Hi!

I'm a DevOps engineer, Linux system administrator, Python and Ruby developer, and generally a jack-of-all-techs.

I'm currently based in California, where (amongst my other hats) I do Site Reliability Engineering for LinkedIn.

I can be reached by electronic mail at <a href=mailto:hello@reedmurphy.net>hello@reedmurphy.net</a></p>

## ... me, elsewhere
I'm also somewhat active on other bits of the web.
