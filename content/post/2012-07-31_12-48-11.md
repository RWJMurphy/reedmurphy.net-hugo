[Moxie Marlinspike](https://twitter.com/moxie) has written up an overview of his and [David Hulton](https://twitter.com/0x31337/)'s presentation at Defcon 20 last week: [Divide and Conquer: Cracking MS-CHAPv2 with a 100% success rate](https://www.cloudcracker.com/blog/2012/07/29/cracking-ms-chap-v2/).

The key takeaways:

* Reduces the complexity of attacking [MS-CHAPv2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-CHAP) to 2^56 (significantly smaller than attempting to brute-force the user's password)
* Using FPGA's, they have achieved "a worst case of ~23 hours ... and an average case of about half a day" to crack *any* given MS-CHAPv2 handshake
* [chapcrack](https://github.com/moxie0/chapcrack) automagically extracts the information needed to crack MS-CHAPv2 handshakes from packet dumps, giving you a "token" to use with the [CloudCracker](https://www.cloudcracker.com/) Cracking-as-a-Service platform, opening this attack up to anyone
* **"All users and providers of PPTP VPN solutions should immediately start migrating to a different VPN protocol. PPTP traffic should be considered unencrypted."**

Yikes.
