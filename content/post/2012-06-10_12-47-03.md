[Neal Stephenson's CLANG - "Time for a revolution" in swordfighting games](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/260688528/clang)

> "How will this be different than SoulCalibur?" you ask. .....

> **Low-latency, high-precision motion controller:** Critical to a satisfying sword fight is fast, accurate response. This is especially important for CLANG given the depth and complexity of moves that are used in real sword arts. Initially, CLANG will make use of a commercial, third-party, off-the-shelf controller that anyone can buy today

> **Depth:** Roundhouse swings and crude blocks just aren't enough. Real sword fighting involves multiple attacks delivered from different stances, pommel strikes, grappling, feints, and parries.

> **Expandability:** Implementing the longsword style will oblige us to construct a toolkit that can then be used--by us, or by others--to create other examples of what we're calling MASEs (Martial Arts System Embodiments). If your thing is Japanese kenjutsu or Viking sword-and-board, then in principle CLANG should support it.
