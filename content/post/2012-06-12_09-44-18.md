<blockquote><p>PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA— There are female athletes who will be competing at the Olympic Games this summer after undergoing treatment to make them less masculine.</p>
<br /><br />
<p>Still others are being secretly investigated for displaying overly manly characteristics, as sport’s highest medical officials attempt to quantify — and regulate — the hormonal difference between male and female athletes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is utterly ridiculous.</p>
