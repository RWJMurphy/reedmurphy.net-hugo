<blockquote>
<h3>SECOND PLACE: Simple Backups</h3>
<p>The Simple Backups plugin by ReedMurphy took a task that everyone should be doing and made it work without needing to schedule a cron job (unless of course you wanted to). His way of getting around that limitation was ingenious and is something that I will be implementing on some of my own sites in the very near future.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To "celebrate", I've released an <a href="http://get-simple.info/extend/plugin/simple-backups/394/">updated version of Simple Backups</a>, with several stability and bug fixes. Yay! <!-- I've also embedded some very silly javascript in my website, for "the lolz". But, if you're reading this, you've probably already noticed. --></p>

<p>See <a href="http://get-simple.info/blog/2012/04/march-create-a-thon-winners-announced/">the full announcement</a> with all winners. Congratulations to the other winners, and everyone who entered!</p>
