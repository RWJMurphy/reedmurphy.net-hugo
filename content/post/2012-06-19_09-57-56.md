>Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice Jason Clare today said that an R18+ category for computer games would now become a reality after it passed the Federal Parliament.

>The legislation tonight passed the Senate without amendment.

>The reforms bring the classification categories for computer games into line with existing categories used to classify films. It also makes the Australian classification regime more consistent with international standards.

This is great news for Australian gamers.
