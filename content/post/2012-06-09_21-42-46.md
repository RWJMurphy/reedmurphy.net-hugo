[The *League of Legends* team today posted about a brief note about hackers gaining access to an unknown number of players' information ](http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/news/league-legends-account-security-alert).

From their post:

> * Hackers gained access to certain personal player data contained in certain EU West and EU Nordic & East databases ; as a security precaution, we're emailing all players on these platforms
> * The most critical data accessed included email address, encrypted account password, summoner name, date of birth, and – for a small number of players – first and last name and encrypted security question and answer

<!--more-->



As [HackerNews user jemfinch points out](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4087176), LoL's stating how many accounts shared password hashes implies the passwords were not salted before hashing.

> We compared encrypted password hashes and discovered that 11 passwords were shared by over 10,000 players each
