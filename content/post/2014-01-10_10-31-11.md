It's a succinct article on recognizing and dealing with trolls, and you can [read Dealing With Trolls on The Feminist Observer's blog](http://www.thefeministobserver.com/#!Dealing-with-Trolls/cxpt/4BAC3EF9-4A64-479E-A6E4-D0B10C4ABA52), or check it out with the rest of the articles in their [January 2014 issue](http://www.thefeministobserver.com/#!january-2014/c1b0b).
