[Women&&Tech](http://womenandtech.com/)

>A Simple Plan

>We're going to share stories about smart women doing important things

>We will ask a group of clever women out for coffees to pick their brains and share our conversations. We're not endorsing the obvious; we want to get under the surface of what it's like to be a woman working in tech.

> ...

> We will interview these women about their experiences, and present that content as public recognition for their efforts and encouragement to put themselves out in the community.

Sounds good to me - taking steps to help redress the unequal representation that women have in IT, and showcase their work.
