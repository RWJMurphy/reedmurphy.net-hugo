[Security vulnerability in MySQL/MariaDB sql/password.c](http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q2/493)

>All MariaDB and MySQL versions up to 5.1.61, 5.2.11, 5.3.5, 5.5.22 are
vulnerable.  
> MariaDB versions from 5.1.62, 5.2.12, 5.3.6, 5.5.23 are not.  
> MySQL versions from 5.1.63, 5.5.24, 5.6.6 are not.  

> ...

> Which means, if one knows a user name to connect (and "root" almost
> always exists), she can connect using *any* password by repeating
> connection attempts. ~300 attempts takes only a fraction of second, so
> basically account password protection is as good as nonexistent. 
> Any client will do, there's no need for a special libmysqlclient library.
