[Catch-22: Tech Blogging As a Woman](http://codingkilledthecat.wordpress.com/2012/07/01/catch-22-tech-blogging-as-a-woman/)

> The catch-22 here is that if I choose to blend in, then people like the commenters above assume that everything they see was written by men, and use that as an excuse to dismiss the concerns of women in the tech industry – because apparently, we don’t contribute and thus don’t matter. If I choose to not blend in, I’m dismissed as bringing up gender when it’s irrelevant (or worse, harassed by people who’ve decided gender is relevant).
