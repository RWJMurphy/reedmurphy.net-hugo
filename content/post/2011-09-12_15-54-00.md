<p>Had an interesting issue with a client's email today - messages originating from one of our servers were being bounced by <code>grey-area.mailhostingserver.com</code> with a SMTP 554 error:
<blockquote><code>554 5.7.1 Service unavailable; Client host [x.x.x.x] blocked using aspews.ext.sorbs.net; Access Denied See: http://www.aspews.org/?ip=x.x.x.x</code></blockquote>

<p>This came as quite a surprise, since we check all our assigned IP addresses hourly against several well-known <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/DNSBL" title="DNS blacklists">DNSBLs</a> (shameless plug for <a href="http://whmscripts.net/downloads/rblcheck.sh">rblcheck.sh</a>, the script I wrote to <a href="http://whmscripts.net/email/2010/rbl-check-initial-release/">automate checking all our servers IPs against DNSBLs</a>).

<p>To quote <a href="http://www.aspews.org/">their website</a>, ASPEWS is:
<blockquote>
a list of areas on the Internet which several system administrators, ISP postmasters, and other service providers have assembled and use to deny email and in some cases, all network traffic from.</blockquote>

<p>Unlike most DNS blacklists, ASPEWS does not block specific hosts; rather, they list entire ranges belonging to <a href="http://www.aspews.org/?page_id=6">"either a spam source, or a spam support service"</a>.  This is the same technique applied by the (long defunct) <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Spam_Prevention_Early_Warning_System">SPEWS</a> system and its successor <a href="http://www.apews.org/">APEWS</a> (in fact, the ASPEWS and APEWS FAQ pages are nearly identical).  Like both these services, there appears to be no method for getting an IP address / range removed from ASPEWS and no way to contact those "maintaining" the list.  According to the <a href="http://www.aspews.org/?page_id=9">ASPEWS FAQ</a>: "[our] best option is to try and educate [our] provider or switch to one who is not listed in ASPEWS as spam friendly".

<p>In our case, ASPEWS have blacklisted every IP range assigned to the company we lease this server from.  Moving our entire service because a single blacklist thinks our hosting company is "spam friendly" is not really an option.

<p>Having ruled out getting ourselves removed from ASPEWS, we tried to find someone to contact at <code>grey-area.mailhostingserver.com</code> in order to get our IP ranges whitelisted on their end.

<p>It turns out that <code>grey-area.mailhostingserver.com</code> is a blackhole SMTP server that was assigned to the client's domain at the point that their domain registration lapsed.  The domain registrar in question changed the nameservers on the domain to their own "expired domain" nameservers, set <code>grey-area.mailhostingserver.com</code> as the MX record and assigned somewhat excessive TTLs to them - 24 hours for the NS entries, and <strong>48</strong> for the MX record.  It looks like this may be common practice for at least a few registrars - quick googling found <a href="http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=435138&amp;cid=22234788">this comment on /. from 2008</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google%20Apps/thread?tid=4b09fdbf01155609&amp;hl=en#fid_4b09fdbf01155609000498b0b48f77d0">this discussion from 2009</a>, and <a href="http://www.alanblainewhitney.com/2010/01/05/register-com/">this blog post from 2010</a>.
