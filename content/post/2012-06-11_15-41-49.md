I'm a few days late on this one, but [Dungeons of Dredmor: You Have To Name The Expansion Pack](http://www.gaslampgames.com/2012/06/05/dungeons-of-dredmor-free-expansion-available-now/)
has been released.

> What’s new? Here’s what:

> - Rebalancing of many original skills (now you can smith more flesh into zombys with **Fleshsmithing**, find more loot with **Perception**, fire more cannons at the same time with **Piracy**, and much more)
> - **29** new skills in 4 skill lines from the minds of mad Dredmor modders
> - **100+** new rooms filled with Tesla coils, lots of breakable stuff, and fine dining furniture (which is also breakable).
> - **20** new monster variations (including one new monster type)
> - **30** new crafting recipes
> - **47** new items from the Clockwork Grappling Bolt to the Rusty Caltrop Eruptor Trap
