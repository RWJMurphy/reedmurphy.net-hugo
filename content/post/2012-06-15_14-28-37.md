I needed to extract some browser version information from some [Splunk-indexed S3 / Apache access logs](http://www.reedmurphy.net/blog/post/splunking-through-amazon-s3-access-logs) today. A quick Google search was unilluminating, so I thought I'd document my own work here.

Rather than delving into the dark arts of defining Splunk extractions and transforms, I figured it would be a good chance to learn about using [`rex`](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/SearchReference/rex) for ad-hoc field extracts while searching. What I've come up with is just a quick braindump for now, and only supports a subset of all browsers, but I'll try to update this snippet as it evolves.

<!--more-->

    sourcetype="access*"  | 
    rex field=useragent "(?<browser>(?<browser_software>(?<browser_version>.*)))" |
    rex field=useragent "(?<browser>(?<browser_software>MSIE) (?<browser_version>[0-9.]+));" |
    rex field=useragent "(?<browser>(?<browser_software>Firefox)/(?<browser_version>[0-9.]+))" |
    rex field=useragent "Version.*(?<browser>(?<browser_software>Safari)/(?<browser_version>[0-9.]+))" |
    rex field=useragent "(?<browser>(?<browser_software>Chrome)/(?<browser_version>[0-9.]+))"


The first `rex` line defaults the `browser*` fields to the full UA string, and each subsequent `rex` line extracts the browser information for a particular browser, storing the software name in `browser_software`, the version in `browser_version` and the combined result in `browser`.
