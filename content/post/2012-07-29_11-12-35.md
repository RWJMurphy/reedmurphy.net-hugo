Notch on [Gender in Minecraft](http://notch.tumblr.com/post/28188312756/gender-in-minecraft):

> The human model is intended to represent a Human Being. Not a male Human Being or a female Human Being, but simply a Human Being. The blocky shape gives it a bit of a traditional masculine look, but adding a separate female mesh would just make it worse by having one specific model for female Human Beings and male ones. That would force players to make a decisions about gender in a game where gender doesnâ€™t even exist.
