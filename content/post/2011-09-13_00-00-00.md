<p>Announcing my first plugin for GetSimple - add RSS functionality to your News Manager blog with the uncreatively named <a href="/projects/news-manager-rss-plugin">News Manager RSS plugin</a>.

<p>It's a fairly simple plugin, displaying the latest <code>$x</code> posts from your News Manager in RSS 2.0 format. It also injects an RSS autodiscovery tag into the header of your site, for ease of discovery.
