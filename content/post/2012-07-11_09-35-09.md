A [recent study](http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=1206779 "Toxoplasma gondii Infection and Self-directed Violence in Mothers") published in the Archives of General Psychiatry has shown a strong link between [*Toxoplasma gondii* (*T. gondii*)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasma_gondii) infections ([toxoplasmosis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxoplasmosis)) in women and an increased risk of self-directed violence and suicide.

Teodor T. Postolache, MD &mdash; one of the paper's authors &mdash; is quoted by [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/daviddisalvo/2012/07/05/is-your-cat-hosting-a-human-suicide-parasite/ "Is Your Cat Hosting a Human Suicide Parasite?") as saying:
> We canâ€™t say with certainty that *T. gondii* caused the women to try to kill themselves, but we did find a predictive association between the infection and suicide attempts later in life that warrants additional studies. We plan to continue our research into this possible connection.

*T. gondii* has previously been shown to cause behavioural changes in its hosts &mdash; infected rodents, in particular, are less fearful of cats &mdash; and has been linked to psychiatric conditions in humans such as depression, anxiety and schizophrenia.
